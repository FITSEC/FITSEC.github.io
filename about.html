          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p>FITSEC is Florida Tech's Cyber Security team who is focused on
            competing in Cybersecurity competitions. Not only do we offer
            students the opportunity to hone their skills with respect to
            hacking and counter-hacking, but we also are building connections
            with industry to provide a pathway for potential employment
            opportunities. We believe the best way to stop a hacker is to know
            their methods.</p>

          <br />
          <h3>CYBER DEFENSE</h3>
          <p>Cyber Defense competitions revolve around keeping a red team out of
            the network through various defensive methodologies and
            technologies. Some competitions such as Hivestorm are focused on
            patching and reconfiguring vulnerable machines. All defensive
            competitions are fast-paced and require tenacity and quick thinking.
            Florida Tech offers a Cyber Defense course that helps students
            prepare for careers in securing networks from hackers.</p>

          <h1 id="offensive">Offensive Team</h1>
          <br />
          <h3>CTF (Capture the Flag)</h3>
          <p>Capture the flag competitions pit teams against each other in a
            race against time to solve as many security related challenges as
            possible. CTFs are typically exploit based, however, some CTFs are
            defensive as well. The most typical style of CTF that FITSEC
            competes in are jeopardy-style CTFs where competitors analyze web
            applications and programs in order to retrieve flags through various
            means. These flags are then submitted for points to climb
            scoreboard. Courses that are offered at Florida Tech that help build
            the foundation necessary to tackle these problems include
            Introduction to Cybersecurity, Introduction to Reverse Engineering,
            and Introduction to Vulnerability Research.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Penetration Testing and Red Teaming</h3>
          <p>Penetration testing competitions are aimed towards identifying
            vulnerabilities in a network and exploiting them to gain additional
            footholds and establish persistence. The same methodologies used by
            hackers are used to test networks. These exercises end in the pen
            testing team writing a report based on their findings where they can
            recommend to the blue team how best to update their security. For
            red teaming events, the red team plays against a live blue team
            where they actively try to keep the red team from gaining access.</p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Q: Do I need experience to join?<br />A:</strong> Nope! We have a training pipeline created to teach the basics to newcomers. This pipeline gives each new member a solid foundation that enables them to delve deeper into areas of interest and specialize to be more of an asset to the team.</li>
              <li><strong>Q: Do I need to be Computer Science to join?<br />A:</strong> Absolutely not! Being a Computer Science or Computer Engineering student definitely gives you a good start, but anyone is capable of learning about cybersecurity. In fact, some of our competitors have been Aerospace Engineers.</li>
              <li><strong>Q: When does FITSEC meet?<br />A:</strong> It varies per semester. We send out a poll early in the semester to identify times that are the most convenient for the members to maximize attendance.</li>
              <li><strong>Q: Where does FITSEC meet?<br />A:</strong> This has varied in the past, however, our permanent home is now Crawford 524. This is the room for all cybersecurity classes and also FITSEC's clubhouse.</li>
